# Inventory Management

[Live server]()

This is my first project where I am designing the <b>Schema</b> and using <b>MVC-Architecture</b>. [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used here to design the schema efficiently and effectively.

### Installed packages

- node
- express
- cors
- dotenv
- mongoose
- colors

### The pattern of Mongoose

1. Design <b>Schema</b>.
2. Then create a <b>Model</b> from the Designed Schema.
3. Then do <b>Query</b> operations on the model.
