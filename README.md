# Inventory Management

[Live server]()

This is my first project where I am designing the <b>Schema</b> and using <b>MVC-Architecture</b>. [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used here to develope the project efficiently and giving it an industry level feel.

### Topics covered

I used <b>Service Layer Architecture with MVC</b>. The concepts used in this projects are <b>Fat Model/Thin Controller</b> and <b>Separation of Concern</b>. By using these concepts the code is structured in an organized way.

### Design overview

- <b>controllers:</b> All the controllers.
- <b>models:</b> Schema design and the Product model.
- <b>routes:</b> All the routes.
- <b>services:</b> All the business logic/database call.

### Installed packages

- node
- express
- cors
- dotenv
- mongoose
- colors
- bcrypt

### The pattern of Mongoose

1. Design <b>Schema</b>.
2. Then create a <b>Model</b> from the Designed Schema.
3. Then do <b>Query</b> operations on the model.
